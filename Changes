Revision history for Perl extension Audio::Play::MPG123

0.63 Thu Mar  3 18:00:52 CET 2005
	- updated to mpg123 2001-05-18.
        - added new frame accessor method, patch by Steven Elling.
        - change of contact address.

0.62 Sun Feb  4 13:39:04 CET 2001
	- implemented SHuffle command for mpg123sh.
	- forgot to include playlist.h. However, mpg123
          is being used by somebody so this kind of bug gets found ;)
	- mpg123's stderr is now redirected to /dev/null.
        - mpg123sh no longer depends on File::Glob.
        - mpg123 no longer destroys your terminal settings.

0.61 Thu Jan 18 19:46:45 CET 2001
	- load now returns even whent he song couldn't be started :)
        - mpg123 is now started without the "-y" flag, since this
          also disables id3-tag-detection.

0.6  Wed Jan 17 10:49:33 CET 2001
	- updated to version 2001-01-17 of mpg123. Left out a lot
          of my patches (e.g. IRIX6). tell me if you need them.
        - mpg123sh now stops on SIGPWR (send it from your
          /etc/apmd_proxy) (requires recompile of mpg123!).
        - new parameter "mpg123args" which expects an arrayref with
          additinal arguments for mpg123.
