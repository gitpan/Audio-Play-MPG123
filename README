NAME

  Audio::Play::Play::MPG123 - generic frontend for mpg123

SYNOPSIS

  use Audio::Play::MPG123;
  
  $player = new Audio::Play::MPG123;
  $player->load("kult.mp3");
  print $player->artist,"\n";
  $player->poll(1) until $player->stat == 0;

  $player->load("http://x.y.z/kult.mp3");

  # see also mpg123sh from the tarball

DESCRIPTION

  This distribution contains a module that can be used to control an
  mpg123 process and a sample application that implements a "mp3 player
  shell" on top of it.

  I wrote it because I really hate all these nifty frontend that take
  sparse desktop space. Xmms came close, but I couldn't get it to work
  (xmms, not the pelr interface module), so I wrote my own wrapper around
  mpg123.

INSTALLATION

  Get your hands on a suitable mpg123 player (version 0.59r and above
  should be fine, but the included version is better because it uses less
  resources and has a few bugs fixed). Look in the subdirectory mpg123/,
  compile the mpg123 binary and put it somewhere in your path, or edit the
  variable $MPG123 in the file MPG123.pm to point to its location.
